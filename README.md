# bash_script_bootstrap.sh.inc

## Scripting Approach

Included are example notes for general bash scripting. While AI could
generate these for you, I prefer diving into a repo, using it as a
bootstrap, and tweaking it to fit my needs with AI assisting via
auto-completion. My approach is a bootstrap â†’ refactor cycle for bash
scripts. These notes reflect my personal preferences, even if not
explicitly mentioned. For instance, I quote strings like "${xxx}" and
use curly braces. Working directly in a repo allows me to experiment
quickly and move past the perceived messiness of bash scripting.

This script contains an example function, `example-function`, that demonstrates
how to process input parameters, handle flags, positional arguments, and
validate user input in shell scripts. It serves as a template for building
other functions or scripts that require command-line input processing.

## Features

- **Flag Handling**: Supports both short and long flags (e.g., `-f`, `--first`).
- **Positional Arguments**: Handles positional arguments, ensuring they are provided in order.
- **Parameter Validation**: Checks for missing values or invalid flags and provides clear error messages.
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Automatically handles case-insensitive flags (`-f` and `--first` are equivalent).

## Usage

### 1. Source the script

To use the `example-function`, source the script into your shell session or script.

```bash
source bash_script_bootstrap.sh.inc
```
